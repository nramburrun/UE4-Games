# UE4_Games - 3rd Person Power Up Game with C++

Simple project on using Unreal Engine 4 along with some of its tools (Blueprints, Physics, Particles, Game States, Actors etc).

The character spawns with a default decay value. Each second, his power level decays by a certain amount and as a result, the color of his body will change from Cyan (Empty) to Red (Full). His speed is also dependent on the Power Level.
Pickup batteries to increase power level and survive.

Many more features will be implemented in this game; this is purely an introduction to the amazing things UE4 can do.
